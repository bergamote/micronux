# Micronux

Micronux will be a graphical editor for Linux to edit patches from the Alesis Micron synthesiser.  
It is just meant as a front end to edit for the text files generated by Alesis' program decoder/encoder perl script. 

### Work in progress

Micronux is in early days development and doesn't do anything useful right now. For something that actually works on GNU/Linux, see the simple (yet smart) perl script by ralphgonz [here](https://sites.google.com/site/ralphgonz/music-micron).

### [To Do List](docs/TODO.md)

### About

Micronux is written in **python** and uses the **PySide2** bindings for its **QT** graphical interface, which is built using **QT Designer**. It will use **amidi** to send/receive sysex programs through midi.

The user interface is inspired by the physical layout of the Ion synthesiser as well as existing Mac/Windows editors. Since the amount of controls and settings of the Micron can be overwhelming, the goal is to simplify and promote the more commonly used settings.

Additionally, one goal is to keep Micronux functional on a netbook screen, so limited to a size of 1024x600 pixels. The use of tabs and pop-up windows should eventually give access to all the settings.
