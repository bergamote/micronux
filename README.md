# Micronux

**Micronux** is an editor for Linux to edit programs from the Alesis Micron synthesiser.  
It is a front end to edit the text files generated by Alesis' program decoder/encoder perl script, and doesn't work in real time (but almost).

### Features

  - Receive and send program sysex messages from any available MIDI port.

  - Edit all program settings, including voice, oscillators, envelopes, filters, mixers, effects, modulation routing, tracking generator and assign xyz knobs.

  - Open and save `.syx` or `.txt` Micron program files.

  - Automatically send program sysex on setting change.

  - Check the [To Do](docs/TODO.md) list for possible developments.

### Notes

  - **Warning:** After receiving a program from the Micron, **save a backup copy** before pressing 'send' or enabling 'auto-send', as these options will **overwrite** the program on the Micron.

  - All changes made on the Micron with xyz knobs, slider, etc... are **not** updated in Micronux and discarded the next time you send from Micronux (or make any edits when *auto-send* is enabled).

  - Please report bugs on the [issues](https://github.com/bergamote/micronux/issues) page.


### Install

You're gonna need python3, pip and PySide2. In a terminal type the following:

    sudo apt install python3-pip libasound2-dev
    pip3 install PySide2 wheel

Micronux also depends on the RtMidi bindings from pyrtmidi which can be installed by adding `rtmidi` to the second line, but since there's two modules with that name, installing pyrtmidi could ovewrite python-rtmidi. A way around that problem is to install it in a local folder with:

    pip3 install --target=./micronux/rtmidi rtmidi

Then run `./micronux.py`, or make a launcher shortcut with:

    python3 ./micronux.py --create-launcher

Update to the latest version with `git pull`.


### Usage

To receive a sysex connect your MIDI in and out cables, make sure that the right MIDI port is selected then click `receive`. On the Micron bring up the `Send MIDI sysex?` option and press down the control knob.

Clicking `send` (or enabling 'auto-send' by ticking the checkbox next to it) will **overwrite** the program with the same name on the Micron.

To create a new program from the current one, click on the program's name (top line of the middle area) and give it a unique name.

The `revert` button *should* revert the changes made since the last open, save or receive (whichever came last). In case of problem, the last received program is automatically backed up in the `programs/cache` folder.


### About

*Micronux* is written by [Pevin Kinel](http://pevinkinel.com) in **Python 3** and uses the **PySide2** bindings for its **QT** graphical interface, which was made using **QT Designer**. It uses **pyrtmidi** to send/receive sysex programs through MIDI. The non-linear time dials are by [Daniel Appelt](https://github.com/danielappelt).
