### To do list
*micronux*

  - add export:

      - button to send program with **amidi**

      - automatically send program on setting change. Note: when? on-release or every-second or what?

  - improve widgets:

      - effects: swap widget when needed (ie: sync on/off with checkbox instead of a dial) and implement sync multiples (param c sync)

      - assign xyz knobs, mods, sh... through pop-up window

      - implement a non-linear slider for time, and maybe freq, related settings (log curve)


  - show value on "lcd" when focusing (right-click) on a widget

  - option to rename program (pop up dialogue)

  - request program sysex from within micronux

  - option to revert modified program to received/opened program.  

  - make a 1920x1080 layout with **Qt Designer** where all envelopes, effects, mods and tracking are visible. Maybe not a great idea (settings overload)

  - add visual representation of oscillators, and everything else (if possible)!

  - reimplement the decoder/encoder perl script in python (maybe)
