### To do list
*micronux*


  - improve widgets:

      - effects: focus correct toolbox on effect change. Update a/b/c/... labels, change widget min/max value and swap widget when needed (ie: sync on/off with 2 radio buttons instead of a dial)

      - assign xyz knobs, mods, sh... through pop-up window

  - show value on "lcd" when focusing (right-click) on a widget

  - receive sysex from menu bar (now only command line)

  - add save functionality (syx or txt files).

  - option to rename program (pop up dialogue)

  - send program with **amidi** from menu bar

  - request program sysex from within micronux

  - button to revert modified program to synth received program.  

  - automatically send program on setting change. Note: when? on-release or every-second or what?

  - implement a non-linear slider for time, and maybe freq, related settings (log curve)

  - use *amidi* and *alsa conf* to make the midi port selectable from a menu. Automatically select if only one port.

  - reimplement the decoder/encoder perl script in python (maybe).

  - make a 1920x1080 layout with **Qt Designer** where all envelopes, effects, mods and tracking are visible. Maybe not a great idea (settings overload).

  - add visual representation of oscillators, and everything else (if possible)!
