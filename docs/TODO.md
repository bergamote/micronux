## To do list

*Micronux*


### Before beta

  - option to rename program

  - convert ui to py file


### Later

  - swap fx param widget when needed (ie: sync on/off with checkbox instead of a dial)

  - pop-up window to assign xyz knobs and select inputs of sh, mods and tracking

  - implement a non-linear slider for time, and maybe freq, related settings (log curve)
